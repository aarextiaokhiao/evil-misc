Four normal things:
16 replicanti, doubling: 1% more
256 replicanti, doubling: cap x2
16^8 replicanti, x16^4 for each: one more replicanti produced in replication
16^16 replicanti, general cost (16^16)^(n^2): 1/16 stronger production after cap
(percent divided by 2 ** (log(over cap) / (log(cap) * n)))
but lose all other normal upgrades

reset to gain the benefits of bought upgrades

cap maxes out at 16^256

Four IP upgrades:
1 IP, doubling: 10% more at start
16 IP, general cost 16^(n^2): can increase replicanti cap 16^16 higher
16^4 IP, x16^4 for each: stronger IP formula (2x per infinity, increase to 3x, etc.)
16^16 IP, general cost (16^16)^(n^2): more mirrors
(get percent^n / 100 mirrors, (mirrors + 1) multiplies your replication number)
but lose all upgrades and IP

Also, autobuyers, but that's later.

Note that 16^4 IP, x16^4 for each seems kind of weird, but it's required. Already, if you get 6.5e3 IP and get the upgrade, you just got a factor of 1.5^16 = 657 more IP. This makes a lot of stuff very easy to get.

For each milestone you get 1% extra at start,
and for every 4 milestones you get one more replicanti produced in replication

milestones: 2^2^n replicanti for n from 0 on, 2^2^n IP for n from 0 on

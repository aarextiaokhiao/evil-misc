Currently, in an 18-hour run, I get 206 tickspeed upgrades with 1e22 time shards.

I need 1e39 time shards with my current TT to get 308 tickspeed upgrades.
Even with 15 of the relevant study, I need 5e35 time shards. This will take forever,
since it requires, optimistically, 1e10 more EP. Can we define infinite time in some easier way?
That or give more tickspeed upgrades?
I'm not sure how we'd give more tickspeed upgrades in an elegant way at this point.

Ok, here's the idea. We push infinite time back to a currently non-existent 11th achievement row,
take "8 nobody got time for that" instead, and profit. This makes the 60 TT time studies in some sense unnecessary,
so I guess either they're subject to removal (clear), they're getting stronger (to actually allow access to EC1),
or EC1 eternity requirements are going down, at least the first time (same). Still, I think the 60 TT time studies
are kind of neat and so will keep them for now.

What's the "8 nobody got time for that" reward? Reward: Time dimensions are multiplied by eighth root of eighth dimensions.

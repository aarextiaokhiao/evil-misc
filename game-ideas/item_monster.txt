items and monsters:

15 potions/wands (they're the same):
bad:
poison
blindness
confusion
fire (burns you)
lose item (makes you lose a random item)

good:
health
sustenance (gives nutrition)
scaring (makes you scarier)
teleportation
invisibility

meta:
resistance (gives resistance to chosen potion effect when used)
charging (each carried wand is 20% of the time destroyed and otherwise given 0-3 more charges)
identification (allows you to identify chosen item you have)
randomness (gives independent random effect of other potion when used)
nothing

18 monsters:
ant: fast, small (thus weak), poisonous, eats insects, sometimes comes in groups
bat: fast, small, flying (can thus avoid non-flying), eats insects
cat: normal, pet, nips sometimes but boosts magic
dog: normal, pet
elemental: earth digs pits, water splashes water (which can rust),
fire attacks with fire, air blows you. Does not eat. Otherwise normal.
fungus: does not move, randomly grows
gnome: peaceful, intelligent, often has mining tools
horse: normal, pet, herbivorous
imp: intelligent, small, spawns more the further you go
jackal: normal, sometimes comes in groups
kobold: intelligent, fairly weak
light: slow, but explodes, giving a random bad effect to adjacent,
when it gets next to a monster, with a certain chance.
Does not eat.
millipede: slow, small, poisonous, eats insects
nymph: intelligent, rather than attacking tries to steal items,
starts with a teleport wand, teleports when in distress
orc: intelligent, fairly strong. Basically just stronger kobold
bug (x): very small (so very weak), not poisonous, does leave corpse
newt (:): small, boosts magic a bit (permanently) if eaten
demon (&): intelligent, large, spawns more the further you go,
starts with some bad wands, can also summon other monsters once
(including, perhaps, more demons) (not more than once to prevent demon explosion)

Tonight I have to find somewhere safe to put this file since I like it but not right now.
I think evil-misc works.

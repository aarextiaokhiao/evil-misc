Challenges:
1. You cannot get Mini Resets. Reward: more Mini Resets (exponent goes up by 1/8 instead of 1/4).
2. You cannot get First Resets. Reward: more First Resets (exponent goes up by 1/8 instead of 1/4).
3. You cannot get Ultimate Resets. Reward: more Ultimate Resets (square rather than cube).
4. Production multiplied by time since reset in minutes for first minute since reset.
Reward: Production multiplied by inverse of time since reset in minutes for first minute since reset.
5. Production multiplied by inverse of time since reset in minutes after first minute since reset.
Reward: Production multiplied by time since reset in minutes after first minute since reset.
6. First 8 resets of given type have half power. Reward: First 8 resets of given type have double power.
7. All resets of given type after first 8 have half power.
Reward: All resets of given type after first 8 have double power.
